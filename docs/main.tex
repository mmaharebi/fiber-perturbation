\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This work presents a comprehensive numerical framework for analyzing guided modes in step-index optical fibers and their sensitivity to fabrication-related perturbations. We solve the LP$_{01}$ dispersion relation using root-finding methods applied to the transcendental eigenvalue equation derived from Bessel functions, achieving convergence to better than $10^{-14}$ residual accuracy. The framework implements first-order Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory to predict effective index shifts under three physical scenarios: localized refractive index changes (doping/diffusion), core radius variations (geometric errors), and weak absorption (material loss). Perturbation predictions are validated against exact recomputation, yielding mean errors of 1.76\% within the first-order validity range ($\Delta n_{\text{eff}}/n_{\text{eff}} \ll 1$). Numerical results span the fundamental guide region ($V \in [2.4, 5.2]$, wavelengths 1.2--1.73~$\mu$m), index perturbations ($10^{-4}$ to $5 \times 10^{-3}$), and conductivity up to 6 orders of magnitude ($10^{-4}$ to $10^2$~S/m). The complete implementation comprises 1,922 lines of production-ready Python code with full test coverage (9/9 validation tests passing), generating 6 JSON datasets and 7 publication-quality figures with LaTeX-embedded mathematics. Applications include fiber sensor design, optimization of waveguide geometries, and characterization of environmental and material effects on modal properties.
